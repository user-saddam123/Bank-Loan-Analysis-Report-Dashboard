### Project Objective or Overview
To monitor and assess bank lending activities, a thorough bank loan analysis report was developed. The objective was to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time, aiding data-driven decision-making, tracking loan portfolio health, and identifying trends for lending strategy.
#

### KPI Requirements
1. Total Loan Applications: Compute the total number of loan applications received during a specific time period. Monitor changes on a month-to-date (MTD) and month-over-month (MoM) basis.

2. Total Funded Amount: Comprehend the total amount of funds disbursed as loans. Illustrate MTD and MoM changes.

3. Total Amount Received: Track the total amount received from borrowers to assess the bank's cash flow from repayments. Analyze MTD and MoM changes.

4. Average Interest Rate: Calculate the average interest rate across all loans. Monitor MTD and MoM variations to gain insights into the overall cost of the lending portfolio.

5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers to gauge their financial health. Compute average DTI for all loans and analyze MTD and MoM changes.
#

### Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs Requirement

 * Good Loan Application Percentage: Calculate the percentage of loan applications classified as good loans. This category encompasses loans with a fully paid status.
 * Good Loan Applications: Identify the total number of good loan applications.
 * Good Loan Funded Amount: Calculate the total funded amount in the good loan category.
 * Good Loan Total Received Amount: Identify the total received amount in the good loan category.
#
 * Bad Loan Application Percentage: Calculate the total bad loan percentage. This category encompasses charged-off loan status.
 * Bad Loan Applications: Identify the total number of bad loan applications.
 * Bad Loan Funded Amount: Identify the total bad loan funded amount.
 * Bad Loan Received Amount: Identify the total received amount via the bad loan category.
#

### Dashboard Overview Requirements

The dashboard will present crucial loan-related metrics and trends using various chart types to provide a clear and insightful view of lending operations.

1. Monthly Trends by Funded Amount: Use a line chart to visualize monthly trends in total loan applications and total funded amount. Employ the issue date as the x-axis.
2. Regional Analysis by State: Use a filled map to illustrate the regional distribution of funded amounts.
3. Loan Term-Based Analysis: Use a donut chart to depict the proportion of short-term (36 months) and long-term (60 months) loans.
4. Funded Loan by Employee Length: Use a bar chart to demonstrate the total funded loan amount by employee length.
5. Total Aoan Amount by Purpose: Use a bar chart to illustrate the total funded amount by purpose.
#

### Details Requirement
Utilize a table to present detailed information for each loan, including loan ID, customer name, gender, state, funded amount, received amount, grade, subgrade, and purpose.
